The find_ball_groups method works&#10;about the same as it did in the last commit, except it has been adapted&#10;so that, rather than just using a list of lists of past locations for &#10;each ball stored directly as a table attribute, the table's list is now&#10;full of ball objects. I added a whole bunch of magic to the Ball class,&#10;so that they can be indexed and appended all the same, so very little&#10;change was needed within the find_ball_groups method.

I also added a global cleanframe variable &#10;that is unadulterated by lines drawn by opencv. This is important for&#10;color comparison mainly. I added a third setting under find_balls, that&#10;seems to work a little better. I added a isblurred attribute to the&#10;circle class, which is set to False by default and updated by the &#10;average_motionblur_circles method. I then updated find_ball_groups so &#10;that there is a lower regular color threshold, and one that is used only&#10;if that circle was averaged from a blur. I also added an nmissingframes&#10;attribute to the ball class, which I use to multiply the distthresh by.&#10;I also added a method under the Ball class called is_past_boundary which&#10;take a particular boundary box as an argument, and returns True if the&#10;center of the ball is beyond that boundary. I also added an inpocket &#10;attribute to the Ball class, which is set to true if the ball is outside&#10;that boundary. I also changed the colors used to show the ball groupings&#10;to use the colors of the balls themselves, rather than random bright&#10;colors. This makes it easier to know if balls switch groups, and if the&#10;color average seems accurate. The color of the circles turns to green&#10;if it goes into a pocket.">

    <MESSAGE value="I moved some of the initialization stuff like creating the capture and&#10;viewer instances from the top of the document to the main function. I&#10;also made it so that it re-instantiates the capture object after the&#10;Table is initialized so that it doesn't lose all the frames that the &#10;table uses to find itself. I also added a global cleanframe variable &#10;that is unadulterated by lines drawn by opencv. This is important for&#10;color comparison mainly. I added a third setting under find_balls, that&#10;seems to work a little better. I added a isblurred attribute to the&#10;circle class, which is set to False by default and updated by the &#10;average_motionblur_circles method. I then updated find_ball_groups so &#10;that there is a lower regular color threshold, and one that is used only&#10;if that circle was averaged from a blur. I also added an nmissingframes&#10;attribute to the ball class, which I use to multiply the distthresh by.&#10;I also added a method under the Ball class called is_past_boundary which&#10;take a particular boundary box as an argument, and returns True if the&#10;center of the ball is beyond that boundary. I also added an inpocket &#10;attribute to the Ball class, which is set to true if the ball is outside&#10;that boundary. I also changed the colors used to show the ball groupings&#10;to use the colors of the balls themselves, rather than random bright&#10;colors. This makes it easier to know if balls switch groups, and if the&#10;color average seems accurate. The color of the circles turns to green&#10;if it goes into a pocket." />
    <MESSAGE value="More tuning on the ball continuity stuff. I added a x2 multiplier to the&#10;nmissingframes distancethresh multiplier. I added a pastdists attribute&#10;to the Ball class that I may use to detect anomalous detections. I made&#10;it so that balls that aren't detected at the very beginning start their&#10;own ball object, which goes away if it has a few missing frames and a&#10;total .past length of 2 or less, or if it has been missing for over 20&#10;frames. I currently have it so that it prints the bgr color tuple of&#10;each ball on the table, in the corresponding color. This is just for&#10;debugging, since there seem to be issues with balls swapping groups.&#10;&#10;Now I plan to try to sort the iteration in find_ball_groups by color&#10;differences as a priority, as opposed to distance first like it is now. &#10;I wish myself luck refactoring all that without creating a giant mess." />
    <MESSAGE value="The main thing that I did was to change the dist_list function to&#10;colordiffs_n_distances, which does the same thing as dist_list did, but&#10;adds color differences and sorts by them. This makes it so that similar&#10;colors take priority over close distances. I also made it so that, once&#10;a ball is in a pocket, it won't look for itself on the playfield &#10;anymore. I haven't yet set exceptions for the white ball. That needs to&#10;happen. I increased the color threshold in average_motionblur_circles to&#10;catch more. Keep an eye out for problems with that. I started with a&#10;method to detect intrusions of arms and bodies onto the table. Just&#10;started, so it's not yet doing anything. I also added the ability for&#10;balls and circles to get hsv color. Haven't used it for anything yet,&#10;but I thought I'd play around with that and see where it gets me. I &#10;added a colorpast attribute to the Ball class, which keeps a list of&#10;ballframebuffer x 3 = 15 currently, and that's used to find the average&#10;color of the ball from the past little bit, because in the case of&#10;striped balls, there were some issues. Also added nballs as a global &#10;but haven't implemented it yet. The idea is that it would know that, if &#10;there are more balls than that number in its list, the bar for &#10;baller-status needs to be raised. More tomorrow!(:" />
    <MESSAGE value="Changed the blur type in find_balls from median to Gaussian, which seems&#10;to both improve detection, and increase fps. Did some debugging in&#10;find_ball_groups. I made it so that the colorthresh was raised if the&#10;circle is white, since the queball often goes very quickly and blurs,&#10;making it look much more like the table color. I also added a .ispartial&#10;attribute to the Circle class, which looks at the mean color of each row&#10;and column within the ball crop and determines whether the circle is&#10;made from a stripe on a striped ball or something. I removed the hsv&#10;stuff for the balls to help playback speed. I deemed the detectintrusion&#10;method I had started to be time computationally intensive. Will have to &#10;come up with another solution, or just run that only every n frames." />
    <MESSAGE value="Coolest thing: I increased the fps from ~20 to ~35 by having the table's&#10;find_balls method crop down the playfield image, rather than assigning &#10;zeros. I had to add the cropped amount back into the circle centers&#10;after, but it's way, way faster. Very happy about that.&#10;&#10;I have also started adding the trajectory estimation lines. Currently, &#10;it takes the balls past centers and fits a line to them, then calculates&#10;where the hit-point would be on the wall. Have not yet factored in the&#10;other balls or reflection angles. That's coming. I added a movement&#10;threshold attribute to the balls that determines how far the ball has to&#10;go in a frame to draw the motion line. Also added an ismoving attribute&#10;which I think I will need when it comes to collision estimation. The&#10;ball trajectory estimation is currently all happening in the Ball's&#10;find_future_path method. I also had cProfile sort by time.&#10;&#10;Issues:&#10;- false balls still appear on hands and clothes, and they often appear&#10;randomly, triggering the drawing of trajectory lines. That's the main&#10;issue at the moment." />
    <MESSAGE value="Made some major changes!!&#10;&#10;- Most recently I added the average colors of all of the balls, which&#10;    helps to weed out shirtballs early. that's in the find_balls method.&#10;- I also added a method to the table that sets the loctaions of the&#10;    pockets. I haven't used them yet.&#10;- I changed the draw_circles method so that it can take a list of Circle&#10;    objects, rather than just what houghCircles spits out.&#10;- I added a group to table called allballs, which i don't remove balls&#10;    from, so that I can graph certain things at the end for debugging.&#10;- I added an extra debugging step, which takes the closest color match&#10;    of each circle and appends it to a global list along with the frame&#10;    number, the color diff and the distance between the two, etc.&#10;- More importantly: I added trajectory plotting. It's definitely not&#10;    accurate yet. Still many things to sort out, but once a ball starts&#10;    moving, it fits a line to the past points, and draws a line in the&#10;    direction of motion. If it's going to hit a border, it will show the&#10;    reflection path. It now also figures out whether a ball is going to&#10;    be hit by an oncoming ball, and is currently set to turn the circle&#10;    around the ball red if it is predicted to be hit. I have not yet&#10;    added the ability to predict the exact hit point of the balls, and&#10;    the consequent path of both.&#10;- I moved the inpocket attribute from the Ball class to the Circle class&#10;- I created a Buffer class, which is a subclass of a list, which you can&#10;    set a max length for, saving me some lines of 'if len(x) &gt; y' type&#10;    stuff.&#10;- I also started a motion class that I might might want to use for the &#10;    balls, rather than having all the separate attributes.&#10;- The main important new methods in the ball class are find_future_path,&#10;    ischaotic, and checkballsinpath." />
    <MESSAGE value="Bounce lines are working, but in iffy condition right now.&#10;&#10;- I started splitting up find_future_path into multiple methods so that &#10;    I could make things a bit more recursive.
